      question: 'Why would I provide information about my business openly and help competitors?',
      answer: 'With competition at its peaks, customers are oversaturated with the same businesses providing the same products and services. By educating your audience, you will help them in making an informed decision and look to you as an expert in the subject matter. This will lead to building customer loyalty and a long term trust relationship with your clientele.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How can Content Marketing benefit my business?',
      answer: 'Content marketing can boost your business in several ways. Firstly, it will increase your brand awareness. As the audience will get to know your brand and its value through high-quality content, this will build their trust in your business. As your brand’s base will grow, it will lead to generating website traffic and hence increased sales.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I have to keep creating content?',
      answer: 'Yes! You constantly need to publish content on different platforms to keep achieving results. As the content is being created at a large scale, your content may be pushed down by the new ones and your business becomes invisible. Moreover, content marketing is an ongoing process to boost your business sales.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I measure the results of Content Marketing?',
      answer: 'Determine your return on investment (ROI) and track the results once you invest in the content marketing strategy. Generally, your goals define the metrics you will track as you assess the results. You can see the results by tracking website traffic, bounce rate, social share or you can set up Google Analytics goals on your website. Also, you can track the number of leads, conversion rates in case you want to generate leads.',
